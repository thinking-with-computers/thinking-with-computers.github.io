Thinking with Computers is a SSHRC-funded project on the history of early interactive programming, especially interactive graphics. Right now, the team is me, Scott Richmond, professor of media studies at the University of Toronto; Matt Nish-Lapidus, a Toronto-based media artist and collaborator on the grant; and Breeanna Lohman, PhD candidate in the history of technology at U of T. We’re largely focused on Seymour Papert and his cadre at MIT and their work on Logo starting in the late 1960s, through the early 1980s. This focus is not exclusive; we’re thinking about other systems and their designers in this time period: Sketchpad; NLS; Smalltalk; the Dynabook; Scheme and SICP.
