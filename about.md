Thinking with Computers is a SSHRC-funded project on the history of early interactive programming, especially interactive graphics. Right now, the team is me, [Scott Richmond](https://www.cinema.utoronto.ca/people/directories/all-faculty/scott-richmond), professor of media studies at the University of Toronto; [Matt Nish-Lapidus](https://emenel.ca), a Toronto-based media artist and collaborator on the grant; and [Breeanna Lohman](https://www.ihpst.utoronto.ca/people/directories/graduate-students/bree-lohman), PhD candidate in the history of technology at U of T. We’re largely focused on Seymour Papert and his cadre at MIT and their work on Logo starting in the late 1960s, through the early 1980s. This focus is not exclusive; we’re thinking about other systems and their designers in this time period: Sketchpad; NLS; Smalltalk; the Dynabook; Scheme and _The Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs_.
