One of the most endearing and inspirational aspects of Seymour Papert's thought is his focus and celebration of children's intuitions. Saying explicitly that the overriding of intuition with formal reasoning is "one of the most destructive blocks to learning" (Mindstorms 144), one way to frame Papert's mission in Mindstorms is the redevelopment of trust in our intuitions by way of reframing error as something to be debugged rather than something to be dismayed by. Debugging procedures is the key conceptual prerequisite for most of the pedagogical discussions in Mindstorms, whether they be related to mathematics, physics, or education itself.
