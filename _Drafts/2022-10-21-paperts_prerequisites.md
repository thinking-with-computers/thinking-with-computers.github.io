One of the most endearing and inspirational aspects of Seymour Papert's *Mindstorms* is his focus and celebration of children's intuitions. Saying explicitly that the overriding of intuition with formal reasoning is "one of the most destructive blocks to learning" (*Mindstorms* 144), one way to frame Papert's mission in *Mindstorms* is the redevelopment of trust in our intuitions by way of reframing error as something to be debugged rather than something to be dismayed by. Debugging is the key conceptual prerequisite for most of the pedagogical discussions in *Mindstorms*, whether they be related to mathematics, physics, or education itself. 

What am I trying to say here? Well I want to talk about learning "in the first person", I want to talk about the GAL/ARI conversation, I want to mention that place where the student has to want to learn (and how that bears on the environments Papert wants to create), and all that to talk about the question of prerequisites and blocks to learning as feeding into a virtuous cycle of intuitive learners build intuitive environments to build new intuitive learners (a la Turner and the Democratic Surround).
